### Introduction
Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction

### Run & Run
- Run the data.py (save_data) both for 'train' and 'test' modes
    to generate train_X, train_Y, tokenizers files first.
- Copy train_tokenizers.pkl and rename it as test_tokenizers.pkl
- In lab.py choose a model
- Choose whether to train or predict
- pkl data and csv files should be put in './data'
- logs and saved models will be put in './model3_batch/data'

### Current Model
Under ./model3_batch/model_pure_tf.py.

Requirements: tensorflow-1.9.

Tensorflow 2.0 not supported.

### Known Issues
Weight Decay not Implemented.
